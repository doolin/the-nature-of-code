# The Nature of Code

Some of exercises from the book The Nature of Code by Daniel Shiffman
implemented in plain old HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Part of the motivation
was dipping back into a bit of computational visualization, a long running
interest of mine. Another part of the motivation was recapturing the
absolute joy of building a web site in the old fashioned way. The whole
site is hand-rolled, including the CSS. Sometimes it's good to go back
to basics.


## Progress

So far, all the exercises in Chapters 0 and 1 have been either
completed, or in the case of a couple, commented on the lack
of clarity with respect to the question. Subsequent chapters
will be completed as time and interest permit.


## Other Projects leveraging P5.js

These are both nascent, Life(tm) has other plans for me
right now. However, both provide a basis to continue
at some point in the future.
