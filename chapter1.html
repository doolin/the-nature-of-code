  <h1>The Nature of Code</h1>

  <p>
    Exercises from the book <a href="https://natureofcode.com/">The Nature of Code</a> by Daniel Shiffman.
    The animations are constructed using the <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> library
    (<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/">reference documents for p5</a>). At the moment, all the HTML,
    CSS, and JavaScript is hand-rolled. The page is deployed to S3 via the AWS command line tool invoked
    from a Makefile, and served by CloudFront. S3 and CloudFront are configured with Terraform.
  </p>

  <h2>Chapter 1: Vectors</h2>

  <p>
    Chapter 1 demonstrates P5.js <a href="https://natureofcode.com/vectors/">Vectors</a> as well as
    presenting a few elements of vector arithmetic. The chapter provides an excellent introduction
    to vector arithmetic, and is worth reading in its entirety at least once. For anyone not familiar
    with vectors, the chapter is worth reading in considerable detail.
  </p>

  <h3 id="ex11"> Exercise 1.1: Vectorize existing code</h3>

  <blockquote>
    Take one of the walker examples from Chapter 0 and convert it to use vectors.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Steps for the random walk were biased towards the right at 26%, down at 26%,
    up and left at 24% each. Just this slight bias results in a clear trend,
    can be seen by letting the animation run for a few minutes.
  </p>

  <div class="canvas-container" id="random-walker"></div>

  <p>
    The step size is 1 pixel, and the walker is not confined to the region defined
    by the canvas (cream colored panel above).
  </p>

  <p>
    An additional walker was added mirroring the position of the initieal
    walked. The resulting images has a Rorschach-like quality, albeit skewed
    toweards a 5 o'clock direction. The Rorschach aspect breaks when the walkers
    wrap around the canvas.
  </p>

  <h3 id="ex12"> Exercise 1.2: Vectorize something else!</h3>

  <blockquote>
    Find something else youâ€™ve previously made in p5.js using separate x and y
    variables, and use vectors instead.
  </blockquote>

  <div class="canvas-container" id="distribution-vectors"></div>

  <p>
    This shows three instances of Ex. 0.6, "qualified random variables," all on
    the same canvas and "walking" concurrently. Adding more walkers would be easy.
  </p>

  <h3 id="ex13"> Exercise 1.3: Bouncer</h3>

  <blockquote>
    Extend Example 1.2 into 3D. Can you get a sphere to bounce around a box?
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    First let's figure it out in 2D. The following show a ball bouncing around
    in a rectangular box. Straightforward.
  </p>
  <div class="canvas-container" id="bouncer-1"></div>

  <p>
    Doing this in 3D is a little more involved as it was done in WebGL to
    leverage browser rendering capabilities. WebGL provides primitive
    shapes such as box and sphere which would otherwise have to be created
    by coordinates.
  </p>
  <div class="canvas-container" id="bouncer-2"></div>

  <p>
    This was all relatively straitforward.
  </p>

  <h3 id="ex14"> Exercise 1.4: Write the limit() function for the p5.Vector class</h3>

  <blockquote>
    Write the limit() function for the p5.Vector class:
  </blockquote>
  <pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
      limit(max) {
        if (this.mag() > max) {
          this.normalize();
          this.mult(max);
        }
      }
    </code>
  </pre>

  <div class="canvas-container" id="limit-demo"></div>

  <h3 id="ex15"> Exercise 1.5: Vehicle Acceleration</h3>

  <blockquote>
    Create a simulation of an object (think about a vehicle) that accelerates
    when you press the up arrow and brakes when you press the down arrow.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Leveraging WebGL again, a slab (dark green) and a box (dark red)
    is a reasonable facsimile of some sort of vehicle traveling across
    terrain.
  </p>

  <div class="canvas-container" id="vehicle-acceleration"></div>

  <p>
    The vehicle accelerates when the up arrow is pressed and decelerates when
    the down arrow is pressed. The vehicle wraps around the canvas.
  </p>

  <h3 id="ex16"> Exercise 1.6: Perlin Acceleration</h3>

  <blockquote>
    Referring back to Exercise 0.7, implement an acceleration calculated with Perlin noise.
  </blockquote>

  <div class="canvas-container" id="perlin-acceleration"></div>

  <h3 id="ex17"> Exercise 1.7: Static functions</h3>

  <blockquote>
    Translate the following pseudocode to code, using static or nonstatic functions where appropriate:
    <ul>
      <li>Vector v = new Vector(1, 5);</li>
      <li>Vector u = v.mult(2);</li>
      <li>Vector w = v.sub(u);</li>
      <li>w.div(3);</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>

  <h3 id="ex18"> Exercise 1.8: Gravitational attraction</h3>

  <blockquote>
    Example 1.10 is remarkably close to the concept of gravitational attraction,
    with the object being attracted to the mouse position. In the example,
    however, the attraction magnitude is constant, whereas with a real-life
    gravitational force, the magnitude is inversely proportional to distance:
    the closer the object is to the attraction point, the faster it accelerates.
    I'll cover gravitational attraction in more detail in the next chapter, but
    for now, try implementing your own version of Example 1.10 with a variable
    magnitude of acceleration, stronger when it's either closer or farther away.
  </blockquote>


  <p>
    Why not just use gravity> Mathematically, gravity is expressed as:
  </p>
  <p>
    \( F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \)
  </p>
  <p>
    where:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>\( F \) is the magnitude of the gravitational force between the two masses,</li>
    <li>\( G \) is the gravitational constant (\( 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \,
      \text{m}^3 \, \text{kg}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-2} \)),</li>
    <li>\( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are the masses of the two objects,</li>
    <li>\( r \) is the distance between the centers of the two masses.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Here is an implementation which uses the formula, but with non-physical values
    (for demonstration purposes only).
  </p>

  <div class="canvas-container" id="gravity"></div>

  <p>
    The disk starts at rest and will move by gravitsional attraction
    towards the position of the pointer. See if you can capture the
    disk into a stable orbit around the pointer.
