  <h1>The Nature of Code</h1>

  <p>
    Exercises from the book <a href="https://natureofcode.com/">The Nature of Code</a> by Daniel Shiffman.
    The animations are constructed using the <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> library
    (<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/">reference documents for p5</a>). At the moment, all the HTML,
    CSS, and JavaScript is hand-rolled. The page is deployed to S3 via the AWS command line tool invoked
    from a Makefile, and served by CloudFront. S3 and CloudFront are configured with Terraform.

  <h2>Chapter 1: Vectors</h2>

  <p>
    Chapter 1 demonstrates P5.js <a href="https://natureofcode.com/vectors/">Vectors</a> as well as
    presenting a few elements of vector arithmetic.
  </p>

  <h3 id="ex11"> Exercise 1.1: a random walker tending down and right, implemented with vectors</h3>

  <p>
    Steps for the random walk were biased towards the right at 26%, down at 26%,
    up and left at 24% each. Just this slight bias results in a clear trend,
  can be seen by letting the animation run for a few minutes.
  </p>

  <div class="canvas-container" id="random-walker"></div>

  <p>
    The step size is 1 pixel, and the walker is not confined to the region defined
    by the canvas (cream colored panel above).
  </p>

  <h3 id="ex12"> Exercise 1.2: Find something else youâ€™ve previously made in p5.js using separate x and y variables, and use vectors instead.</h3>
