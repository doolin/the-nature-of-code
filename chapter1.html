  <h1>The Nature of Code</h1>

  <p>
    Exercises from the book <a href="https://natureofcode.com/">The Nature of Code</a> by Daniel Shiffman.
    The animations are constructed using the <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> library
    (<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/">reference documents for p5</a>). At the moment, all the HTML,
    CSS, and JavaScript is hand-rolled. The page is deployed to S3 via the AWS command line tool invoked
    from a Makefile, and served by CloudFront. S3 and CloudFront are configured with Terraform.

  <h2>Chapter 1: Vectors</h2>

  <p>
    Chapter 1 demonstrates P5.js <a href="https://natureofcode.com/vectors/">Vectors</a> as well as
    presenting a few elements of vector arithmetic. The chapter provides an excellent introduction
    to vector arithmetic, and is worth reading in its entirety at least once. For anyone not familiar
    with vectors, the chapter is worth reading in considerable detail.
  </p>

  <h3 id="ex11"> Exercise 1.1: Vectorize existing code</h3>

  <blockquote>
    `Take one of the walker examples from Chapter 0 and convert it to use vectors.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Steps for the random walk were biased towards the right at 26%, down at 26%,
    up and left at 24% each. Just this slight bias results in a clear trend,
    can be seen by letting the animation run for a few minutes.
  </p>

  <div class="canvas-container" id="random-walker"></div>

  <p>
    The step size is 1 pixel, and the walker is not confined to the region defined
    by the canvas (cream colored panel above).
  </p>

  <p>
    An additional walker was added mirroring the position of the initieal
    walked. The resulting images has a Rorschach-like quality, albeit skewed
    toweards a 5 o'clock direction. The Rorschach aspect breaks when the walkers
    wrap around the canvas.
  </p>

  <h3 id="ex12"> Exercise 1.2: Vectorize something else!</h3>

  <blockquote>
    Find something else youâ€™ve previously made in p5.js using separate x and y
    variables, and use vectors instead.
  </blockquote>

  <div class="canvas-container" id="distribution-vectors"></div>

  <p>
    This shows three instances of Ex. 0.6, "qualified random variables," all on
    the same canvas and "walking" concurrently. Adding more walkers would be easy.
  </p>

  <h3 id="ex13"> Exercise 1.3: Bouncer</h3>

  <blockquote>
    Extend Example 1.2 into 3D. Can you get a sphere to bounce around a box?
  </blockquote>

  <div class="canvas-container" id="bouncer-1"></div>

  <div class="canvas-container" id="bouncer-2"></div>

  <h3 id="ex14"> Exercise 1.4: Write the limit() function for the p5.Vector class</h3>

  <div class="canvas-container" id="limit-demo"></div>

  <h3 id="ex15"> Exercise 1.5: Vehicle Acceleration</h3>

  <p>
    Create a simulation of an object (think about a vehicle) that accelerates
    when you press the up arrow and brakes when you press the down arrow.
  </p>

  <div class="canvas-container" id="vehicle-acceleration"></div>

  <h3 id="ex16"> Exercise 1.6: Perlin Acceleration</h3>

  <p>
    Referring back to Exercise 0.6, implement an acceleration calculated with Perlin noise.
  </p>

  <div class="canvas-container" id="perlin-acceleration"></div>

  <h3 id="ex17"> Exercise 1.7: Static functions</h3>

  <p>Rewrite example code to use static functions</p>

  <h3 id="ex18"> Exercise 1.8: Gravitational attraction</h3>

  <p>
    Accelerate towards the cursor position using a gravitational force which becomes
    stronger the close to cursor.
  </p>

  <div class="canvas-container" id="gravity"></div>
