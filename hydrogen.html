  <h1>Random things</h1>

  <p>
    The animations are constructed using the <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> library
    (<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/">reference documents for p5</a>). At the moment, all the HTML,
    CSS, and JavaScript is hand-rolled. The page is deployed to S3 via the AWS command line tool invoked
    from a Makefile, and served by CloudFront. S3 and CloudFront are configured with Terraform.

  <h2>Energy states in the hydrogen atom</h2>

  <p>
    The hydrogen atom, with its single proton and single electron, admits a solution
    to the governing Schrödinger equation, wave functions which probabilistically
    describe the electron's position. Schrödinger's equation is defined by
  </p>

  $$
  \left( -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V \right) \psi = i \hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t},
  $$

  <p>
    where $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $m$ is the mass of the electron,
    $V$ is the potential energy, and $\psi$ is the wave function. The wave function
    is a complex-valued function of position and time, and the probability of finding
    the electron at a given position is the square of the absolute value of the wave
    function. The wave function is normalized, so that the integral of the square of
    the absolute value of the wave function over all space is 1. [GPT-4o 2024-08-01]

  <p>
    The 1s wave function is spherically symmetric, and is the lowest energy state.

  <h2>Shooting star</h2>

  <p>
    Part of the fun of P5.js is experimenting with animations and effects.
    While anything done with P5 could also be done directly on the HTML canvas,
    P5 does provide a lot of convenience. The "shooting star" effect below
    is pretty crude, but the basic technique will scale to more interesting
    effects.

  <h3>Fading away</h3>

  <p>
    Various effects such as aircraft contrails, fireworks, or traces through
    cloud chambers require bening able to "fade" an image over time.
    The following hexagon is a very crude example of fading, and is
    a proof of concept for other simulations in the future.
