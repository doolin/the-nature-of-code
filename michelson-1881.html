  <h2>Michelson's 1881 Ether Drift Experiment</h2>

  <p>
    In 1881, Albert A. Michelson conducted an experiment to detect the motion of Earth through the 
    hypothetical "luminiferous ether" - the medium through which light was thought to propagate. 
    The experiment used an interferometer to measure the difference in travel time for light beams 
    traveling parallel and perpendicular to Earth's motion through the ether.
  </p>

  <p>
    The experiment famously produced a "null result" - no detectable difference in the light travel 
    times, which was unexpected if the ether existed. This null result was one of the key pieces 
    of evidence that eventually led to the development of Einstein's theory of special relativity.
  </p>

  <h3>The Michelson Interferometer</h3>

  <p>
    The Michelson interferometer splits a beam of light into two perpendicular paths using a 
    half-silvered mirror (beam splitter). One beam travels parallel to the direction of Earth's 
    motion through the ether, while the other travels perpendicular to it. After reflecting off 
    mirrors, both beams recombine and create an interference pattern.
  </p>

  <p>
    If Earth were moving through the ether at velocity \(v\), the time for light to travel the 
    parallel path would be: (CHECK THESE EQUATIONS FOR CORRCTNESS, THEY ARE CURSOR-GENERATED)
  </p>

  <p>
    $$t_{\parallel} = \frac{2L}{c} \frac{1}{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}$$
  </p>

  <p>
    And the time for the perpendicular path would be:
  </p>

  <p>
    $$t_{\perp} = \frac{2L}{c} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$
  </p>

  <p>
    The difference in these times would cause a shift in the interference pattern that should 
    be detectable. However, Michelson observed no such shift.
  </p>

  <p>
    The visualization below shows a simplified Michelson interferometer. The light source is 
    represented by the yellow circle, the beam splitter by the blue square, and the mirrors 
    by the red squares. The light paths are shown as animated lines.

  <p>
    <strong>Controls:</strong> Click and drag to adjust the position of the mirrors. The 
    interference pattern at the detector (right side) shows the result of the light path 
    differences. The "ether wind" velocity can be adjusted using the slider below.

  </div>

  <h3>The Null Result</h3>

  <p>
    Michelson's experiment was designed to detect Earth's orbital velocity around the Sun, 
    which is approximately 30 km/s. The expected fringe shift was about 0.04 wavelengths, 
    which should have been easily detectable with the precision of the interferometer.
  </p>

  <p>
    The null result was initially puzzling and led to several theories to explain it, 
    including:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ether drag hypothesis:</strong> The ether might be dragged along with Earth</li>
    <li><strong>Lorentz contraction:</strong> Objects might contract in the direction of motion</li>
    <li><strong>Time dilation:</strong> Time might slow down for moving objects</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These ideas eventually coalesced into Einstein's special theory of relativity, which 
    eliminated the need for an ether entirely.
  </p>

  <h3>Historical Significance</h3>

  <p>
    Michelson's 1881 experiment, along with the more precise 1887 Michelson-Morley experiment, 
    played a crucial role in the development of modern physics. The null result was one of 
    the key pieces of evidence that led to the abandonment of the ether theory and the 
    acceptance of Einstein's special relativity.
  </p>

  <p>
    The experiment also demonstrated the power of interferometry as a precision measurement 
    technique, which continues to be used in modern physics experiments, including the 
    detection of gravitational waves by LIGO.
